                <p>Delta is a state in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Named after the Niger Delta—a large part of which is
                    in the state—the state was formed from the former Bendel State The state was initially created with 12 local government
                    areas in 1991, but was later expanded to 19 and now has 25 local government areas. Its capital city is Asaba which is 
                    located along the River Niger on the northeastern end of the state, while the state's economic center is the city of Warri
                    on the southwestern coastline.</p>
