Backend Considerations
While you didn't ask for backend code, here's what you'll need to consider:

Database to store artwork, user accounts, orders

API endpoints for:

User authentication

Artwork management

Order processing

Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)

6. Deployment
Hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)

Domain registration

SSL certificate for secure transactions

CDN configuration

This plan provides a solid foundation for your e-gallery website. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect or provide more detailed code for particular features?
